This code creates a simple voice-activated assistant named "Jarvis" using Python. It employs the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality, speech_recognition for understanding voice commands, and other libraries for performing various tasks. Here’s a brief description of its components:

1: Initialization: The program initializes the text-to-speech engine and sets the voice property.

2: Greeting Function: The wishME function greets the user based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening) and introduces itself.

3: Voice Command Recognition: The takeCommand function listens for the user's voice input and uses Google’s speech recognition to convert it into text.

4: Main Loop: The main loop waits for user commands. It can:

# Search Wikipedia for a query and read the summary aloud.
# Open specified websites like YouTube, Google, or LinkedIn.
# Provide the current time.
# Open Visual Studio Code.

The assistant continuously listens for commands until the program is stopped.
